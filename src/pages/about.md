## About me

**My name is Xupeng Chen, born in CHINA in 1995.**

I major in biology and minor in statistics in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) during my undergraduate study.
I changed my study field to EE and start my Ph.D. study in [NYU Tandon School](https://engineering.nyu.edu/), mentored by [Prof. Yao Wang](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/yao-wang) in [NYU Video Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/videolab/).
