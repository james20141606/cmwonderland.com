My undergraduate thesis: exSEEK：A bioinformatics tool for exRNA biomarker discovery 

> edit (2019-6-13): the final presentation is over, the last step to graduate is over!



It is a relatively "pleasant" and relaxing thing for me. Since I have devoted and contributed a lot to the exSEEK project, I didn't need to do a lot more on my undergraduate thesis.

## my preparation
- setting up vscode+latex environment
- thuthesis $\LaTeX$ template, [chn and eng version](https://github.com/xueruini/thuthesis)

## midterm presentation
a good feedback from the committe (since I have prepared, practices and refined all this a long time)
