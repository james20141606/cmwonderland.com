ALL the assignments of **Statistic Inferences**. The assignment is written in Rmarkdown/LaTeX, LaTeX is a classic formula editor but a little hard to use intensely. Rmarkdown is introduced by TA and it is a smart syntax supported by RStudio helping with formula, plot visualization and plugin codes running.

You may also find the [**PDF Version**](https://github.com/james20141606/somethingmore/tree/master/statistic_inderences_pdf) of this assignment. Which is more recommended.

Apart from all the math and knowledge I learned from SI course, one of the most useful techniques a obtain from the course is definitely "writing skill". Statistic Inferences is my first statistic minor course. Before this course I rarely use LaTeX or markdown.(Only when I write math model course paper and project report). So I am rusty at writing complex formulas at first. But thanks to this course, I use LaTeX and markdown really proficiently. Now I write nearly every file in LaTeX of markdown. I also want to recommend [**Bear**](http://www.bear-writer.com/), a markdown based notes manager, which is perfect especially for coders. I have transferred all my codes, work, plan to it for nearly two years and it really helps me to be more effective. One of many benefits is I can simply copy all my notes in bear in my posts without changing anything, for hexo and bear both use markdown(as well as Rmarkdown and LaTeX and gitbook and all README file, they all appear in my daily life quite often).
