**exSeek: extracellular RNA analysis tool for noninvasive biomarker**

The aim of this project is to combine **small cell free RNA sequencing techniques** with **machine learning** to identify promising candidate biomarker for cancers. We establish the pipeline from mapping to feature selection and propose a **robust feature selection method** to identify potential biomarkers.

Parts of this works difficulty is its steps and precision it requires. Since our exRNA-seq is different (it has less RNA reads), we have to explore the mapping sequence. We determine sequential mapping order, using peak calling because most long RNAs are fragments in blood. We also did matrix processing and robust feature selection for biomarker identification.

We use our own data: HCC exRNA and two other data: exoRBase and GSE71008 to establish our robust feature selection methods.
