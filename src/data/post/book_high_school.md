I have invited around 100 elite students writing a book about high school life and their choices and dreams. I managed to publish them and they have been reprinted several times.

I also organized 6 booklets, purely experience sharing about college entrance exam and high school olympic games.

They are parts of the contribution during our **return to high school program**. As the team leader, I organized a team with more than three hundreds elite students from top universities in China to return to high school. We built a platform to publish life and thoughts about high school life in a daily basis (and part of the contents turned into the published book). The passages were read more than **440,000** times, influenced more than 5,000 students and their parents. The platform was built on 2014 and it still runs well. Our great work also won us the golden prize in Tsinghua's return to high school activity.

# Knowledge Sharing book

As the program leader and counselor, I organized a project to collaborate with the top students in my high school to share the concrete knowledge with students. I divided them into several parts: olympic games, college entrance exam and other kinds of exams. The booklets are amazing, the top students in Tsinghua, Peking and other Universities generally share their knowledge with the younger students.
