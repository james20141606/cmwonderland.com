This page summarize my summer intern work, includes final report, weekly report, codes, presentation.

To sum up, I mainly do two projects in this summer, which can be divided again into four works:

- [Lichtman Lab](https://lichtmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/):
    - NMJ tracing and segmenting with statistical work
    - NMJ automatic segmentation pipeline

- [Hanspiter Lab](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/people):
    - Synapse prediction
    - Synaptic polarity prediction

For NMJ tracing, segmenting and automatic prediction work, we push forward the project with the generous daily help of our mentor Jeff. 

For Synapse project, I work with Zudi and Donglai, we now rank No.1 in the [CREMI contest](https://cremi.org). And we will submit a paper to CVPR this November.
