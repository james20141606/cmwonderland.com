I have written something about bioinformatics skills as part of two books. The [basic teaching book](https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/lulab/teaching/details) is used to teach undergraduate students in *Bioinformatics Basic* course. I am a teaching assistant of this course this semester. The [advanced teaching book](https://lulab.gitbook.io/training/) is used to teach graduate student and some senior undergraduate students. 

I have spent many time written several chapters of the books. For Basic teaching book I contributed more than 1/3 of the book.
