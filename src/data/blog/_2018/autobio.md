I've spent a lot of my time and energy into this project. I encourage grandpa for many times to write down his experience. I always love and respects my grandpa and grandma for their contribution and sacrifice to the whole family. Their brave, diligent characteristics always give me strength from the deepest of my heart. I typed all my grandpa's manuscripts into word. Grandpa said he always cried when writing down the hard time, I was also deeply touched, about the kindness, wisdom, friendship fifty year ago, they taught me a lot.

I consider the organizing work as a informative and precious course for me. I compose it in gitbook, later in this website, and print it to send to grandparents. To treasure the glorious old days.


I spent a lot of time typing the words, formatting them and organize them in a gitbook page.([Grandpa Bio](https://james20141606.gitbooks.io/grandpa-autobiography/content/)). I also put them on my blog as the first content. As I wrote here: ([GitBook intro & Grandpa’s Bio | James Chen's Blogs](https://www.cmwonderland.com/2018/05/04/gitbook/)), I tried to format it better and print them out, sent several copies to my relatives.

**The first version has been finished**, I am really happy to hear that grandpa is excited to see what I have done. He is motivated to write more about his life. I hope there will be more inspiring and touching old stories soon.
