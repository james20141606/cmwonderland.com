## a jupyter to html version introduction of the two parts:
- image fusion

[**click here**](https://www.cmwonderland.com/poisson_image_editing.html) for **html version** of assignment, you can see codes as well as plots.
- face morhping

[**click here**](https://www.cmwonderland.com/image_morphing.html) for **html version** of assignment, you can see codes as well as plots.


you can enjoy some extra benefits of the [plots codes](https://github.com/james20141606/DIP-assignment/blob/master/first%20assignment/image_fusion/bin/utils.py). Here I have some pretty cool codes to help better visualize the plots by matplotlib
