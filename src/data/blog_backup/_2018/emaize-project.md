**eMaize: Machine Learning for Traits Prediction**

Heterosis is the improved or increased function of any biological quality in a hybrid offspring. We have studied yet the largest maize SNP dataset for traits prediction.

We develop linear and non-linear models which consider relationships between different hybrids as well as other effect. Specially designed model proved to be efficient and robust in prediction maize’s traits.

We proposed a new mixed linear model **Mixed Ridge** with Fast cross validation to pick parameters. We also propose **Metric Regressor** for few shot learning.
