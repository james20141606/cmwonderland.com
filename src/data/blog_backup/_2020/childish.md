Being a CHILD is great, and "impossible". We are dream about being a child again or live "longer". They are actually the same thing. By living like a child, you will find the world interesting, totally fresh everyday. The day, week, month, year, life will become very long, very different, filled with interesting adventures.

So you you want to live longer, you should live like a child. To find more interesting things which interests you.

I will develop a private github repo containing things interest me and find more interesting things, everyone should find their own one!
